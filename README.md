# Welcome to Liquid Investigations!

Liquid Investigations allows you to turn your ARM-based board or PC into a secure collaboration server for investigative journalism projects. It builds upon Ubuntu, Hoover, Hypothesis, and many other projects to enable you to safely and securely collaborate on sensitive projects with minimal set-up.

We have made images available for many popular ARM-based boards, and for the x86_64 architecture. You can run the distribution at the center of a war-room environment, in a federation of other nodes, or in a cloud hosted configuration, depending on your team and security needs.

Note that the project is currently under development, and features are subject to change without warning. To follow the development, we suggest that you use [waffle.io](https://waffle.io), in conjunction with our [issue repository](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/liquidinvestigations/issues)

For more details, take a look at our project wiki [here](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/liquidinvestigations/wiki).

# Getting Started

There are three main ways to begin using the platform:

1. Via our online demo server located at [liquiddemo.org](https://liquiddemo.org).
2. Self-hosted, using one of our x86_64 images.
3. On an ARM-based board, using one of our ARM64 or ARM32 images.

# Download and Install our Images

You can find our nightly images (x86 and ARM) [here](https://liquidinvestigations.org/images/nightly/).

For details of how to install and configure our images, take a look at our project wiki [here](https://github.com/liquidinvestigations/liquidinvestigations/wiki).
